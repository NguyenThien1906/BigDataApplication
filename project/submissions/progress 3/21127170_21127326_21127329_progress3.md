## Problem summary

### Problem

#### Title: Anime recommendation system based on user ratings.

#### Description:

Analyze anime ratings data using Big Data and Machine Learning tools, in order to recommend animes a user has yet to watch, based on the user's rating history.

**Input**: User's rating history on watched animes.

**Output**: Ranking list for recommended animes fitting user's tastes.

### Dataset

**Anime Dataset 2023** [1] by username Sajid from Kaggle, which is a collection of user and anime ratings on one of the largest anime databases and communities - MyAnimeList (myanimelist.net).

The files contributing to the dataset:

**users-score-2023.csv** (1.16GB): **The main data** consisting of user ratings on anime titles, provided by 270K users on 16K anime titles, with a total of 24.3M samples, **99.48% sparsity rate** for only the observed users and anime titles. The file consists of 5 columns:

+ Rating (0-10): User's rating on anime title.
+ Anime ID, Anime Name, User ID, Username: details of user and anime in the ratings.

**anime-dataset-2023.csv** (15.92MB): Details of around 25K anime titles on MyAnimeList. The file consists of 16 columns:

+ **Mal ID, Username**: User's ID and name on the platform.
+ **Gender, Birthday, Location**: Personal information of the user, given voluntarily.
+ **Joined, Days Watched, Mean Score, Watching, Completed, On Hold, Dropped, Plan to Watch, Total Entries, Rewatched, Episodes Watched**: User's implicit profile of their behaviors on the platform.

**user-details-2023.csv** (73.93MB): Details of around 730K users registered on MyAnimeList. The file consists of 24 columns:

+ **Anime ID, Name, English name, Other name**: Anime ID, original name, translated English name and another (usually abbreviated) name it is known of.
+ **Score, Rank, Popularity, Favorites, Scored by, Members**: Anime title's mean score, ranking and side information, on the platform.
+ **Genres, Synopsis, Type, Episodes, Aired, Premiered, Status Producers, Licensors, Studios, Source, Duration, Rating, Image URL**: Extra information on the anime title. 

## Main tasks

1. **Data preprocessing**: Apache Spark preprocesses the datasets retrieved from static files, reformat, clean and prepare the raw data before feeding into the recommendation system.

2. **RS model training**: Train the dataset on ALS model from Apache MLlib.

3. **RS in use**: Input user's rating history to predict a ranking list for recommended animes which user has not watched.

4. **Dashboard**: Visualize predictions and trends with NetworkX-assisted Matplotlib.
